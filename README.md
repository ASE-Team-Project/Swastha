The solution we propose here leverages the integration on Google Fit with the Wear OS smartwatches and Smart Weight Scales.The app connects to the user's Google Fit account and fetches all there all time data and stores it after some processing.The app then utilizes this data to present to the user are all time health monitoring system with a simple yet informative dashboard.The diagram below shows how the data is leveraged for the app.

The now under development app once finished will be compatible for android 11 above and ioS 11 above mobile operating systems.
